# D-Kaytor-Portfolio

This represents a portfolio of projects that I have done using various technologies such:
HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery, AJAX and Firebase

The header on each page (Nav-Bar) provides my email address and links to my Github account, Linked In site and my resume.
The first page provides a brief description about my experience and accomplishments.

The Portfolio page shows images of the various projects I have completed.
Click on the image and it will launch the deployed site for that project.
